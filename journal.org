    Pretty sure I'll use sqlite.
*** GUI
    I /could/ use Gtk, or I could be adventurous and use fyne. I tried it
    before, and it did not work out well, but on the plus side, it is native
    Go, the cgo overhead would go away.

    But after taking a brief look at my fyne experiment, I'll stick with Gtk.
*** Networking?                                          :feature:meditation:
    I could make an attempt to build this as a distributed application so I
    can sync reminders between machines. I think that's a nice idea.
